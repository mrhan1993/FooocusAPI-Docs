# How to

This chapter is currently mostly composed of examples, and additional content may be added in the future. For now, I have divided this chapter into two parts for demonstration.
The first part covers the native features and characteristics of Fooocus, while the second part showcases the unique features and characteristics provided by the API.

> Due to the large number of parameters and the fact that many are common parameters, the requests in the examples of this chapter will not use too many parameters.
> Additionally, I may frequently use `Lightning` to speed up generation.The complete explanation of `params` can be found in [Tutorial/Generate](GenerateEndpoint.md).

Furthermore, the Generate interface offers various types of Response, which are unified in the [Asynchronous/Synchronous](AsyncTask.md) section.
